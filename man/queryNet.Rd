\title{Query the Bayesian network}
\usage{
queryNet(network, target, evidence, ...)

queryNetParallel(network, target, evidence, inparallel = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{The Bayesian network. An object of class \code{grain} (from package \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=gRain}{gRain}), or a character (the path to the \emph{.net} file to be imported)}

\item{target}{character. The node of interest to be modelled and mapped.}

\item{evidence}{matrix or data.frame. Named columns are the known input variables; rows are the discrete states associated to them for each record (NA allowed).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to fix a state (i.e. setting evidence) to one or more nodes, 
as known and independent from any spatial data (e.g. the case of non-spatial variables 
which are equal everywhere). Node name is provided as argument and the associated fixed state as 
character; both node and state names must be typed accordingly to their names in the network.}

\item{inparallel}{logical or integer. Number of cores/processors to be used by \code{queryNetParallel}. 
Default is TRUE, so the maximum number available minus one is set.}
}
\value{
A matrix of probabilities: columns are the target node states and rows are the probabilities associated to each record from argument \code{evidence} (e.g. spatial locations).
}
\description{
This function queries the Bayesian network and returns the probabilities for each 
state of the target node. Available input variables are set as evidence.\cr 
\code{queryNetParallel} works as \code{queryNet}, but makes use of multi cores/processors facilities 
for big network queries, by splitting data into chunks and processing them in parallel.
}
\examples{
data(ConwyData)
network <- LandUseChange

q <- queryNet(network, 'FinalLULC', evidence)
head(q)

## Fix a given node on a state (i.e. fixed evidence) by providing an additional argument
q <- queryNet(network, 'FinalLULC', evidence, Stakeholders = 'farmers')
head(q)

## Use parallel processing
q <- queryNetParallel(network, 'FinalLULC', evidence, inparallel=2)
head(q)

}
