\title{Evidence from extracted spatial inputs.}
\description{
A matrix. The collection of available spatial data (see above) as extracted from each location (i.e. cell) 
  in the catchment, where the latter is represented by the raster object \code{currentLU}. Each value from the spatial data was 
  discretized through \code{\link{dataDiscretize}} or \code{\link{bulkDiscretize}} functions, then assigned to the corresponding 
  state from the Bayesian network (LandUseChange).
