\title{Load a Bayesian network}
\usage{
loadNetwork(network, target = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{The Bayesian network. An object of class \code{grain}, or a character (the path to the \emph{.net} file to be loaded)}

\item{target}{character. The node of interest to be modelled and mapped.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{grain}. The Bayesian network. If \code{target} argument is provided the network is compiled for a faster querying .
}
\description{
This function loads the Bayesian network from a native gRain object of class \code{grain} or an external 
file with extension \emph{.net} (as provided by external softwares \href{http://www.hugin.com/}{Hugin} or \href{http://www.bayesfusion.com/}{GeNIe}), 
optionally compiling the network.
}
\details{
Bayesian networks built with the package \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=bnlearn}{bnlearn} can be imported with the function \code{bnlearn::as.grain}, which converts them into \code{grain} objects.\cr
\emph{.net} file format as provided from Netica 5.24 currently does not correspond to a valid Hugin .net file.\cr
Argument \code{target} has default set to NULL, but if provided the network will be compiled for faster querying.
}
\note{
Under current release, this function wraps a set of hidden functions copied in block from the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=gRain}{gRain} package, as current CRAN policy
discourages accessing hidden functions with the ":::" operator. These functions will be progressively substituted by bnspatial native ones.
}
\examples{
## Load from external file (.net format)
raw = system.file("extdata/LandUseChange.net", package = "bnspatial")
loadNetwork(raw)

## Compile using target node
loadNetwork(raw, 'FinalLULC')
}
